This folder is for development utilities including 
development and test tools. 

Currently there are 

1) testregex: Example of how to reproduce/demo a bug to maintainer (not useful anymore since hostnames should not have _'s)
2) shelltest: Example of how to "fail" a shell script after testing : useful for continous delivery with testing of bash scripts. 
3) build-deploy-rhs-ambari-installer: This was used to deploy version 13 and build tarball.  It will be modularized into a pure build and then jenkins
will take over the mvn deploy:deploy command part later.
